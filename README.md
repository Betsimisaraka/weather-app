You can see my demo by clicking this link with the username [Betsimisaraka](https://github.com/Betsimisaraka/weather-app)

### Build with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Context]()
-   [Html](https://html.org/)
-   [Css](https://css.org)

## Functionality

The functionality of this project are:

-  I can see city weather as default, preferably my current location
-  I can search for city
-  I can see weather of today and the next 5 days
-  I can see the date and location of the weather
-  I can see according to image for each type of weather
-  I can see the min and max degree each day
-  I can see wind status and wind direction
-  I can see humidity percentage
-  I can see visibility indicator
-  I can see air pressure number
-  I can request my current location weather
-  I can convert temperature in Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa

## 1- Explaination about the structure of my project.

- First of all, I have an `index.html` file which is the root of the page. Also the `index.js` that link to the `index.html`. I created a `context` file that contains the `state`, `context` and `reducer`. 

-  Second, I have a `components` folder in which I splited my project into small files such us `App.js` that holdes all the pages. Then the `DisplayWeather.js` this displaies the weather app. Also the `HightLight.js` and the `SearchForm.js` which is the modal for searching a weather in a specific country or city. And also the `Sidbar.js` file which is in the left side of the page.

## 2- Improvement

If I had more time I would have done a part of the project that when I click a specific date in the weather and the weather hightlight should change according to the date that have been clicked.

## 3- The new things that I learned while working on this project

I learned how to rotate the wind compass according the wind direction.

## 4- Challenging part
The most challenge part for me are these few things below:
- To map through the country according to the value of the input.
- To rotate the wind compass according to the wind direction.


## 5- A new explanation about a specific topic

Deffinetly, I want more expalanation about the things that I found the most challenging part. Including: 
- To map through the country according to the value of the input.
- To rotate the wind compass according to the wind direction.
